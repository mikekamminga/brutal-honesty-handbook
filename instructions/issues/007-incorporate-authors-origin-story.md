# Issue 007: Incorporate Author's Origin Story

## Goal

Weave the author's personal narrative into the book's opening to ground the concepts in lived experience and create a stronger connection with the reader from the start.

## Source Content

The text under the heading "The origin of the book" in `instructions/edits/inputs/inputs.md`. This includes the story of the initial insight at 27, the blog post 5 years ago, and the culmination of the book now at age 40.

## Implementation Plan

1.  **Review Existing Prologue and Introduction**: Analyze `book/00_prologue.md` and `book/00_introduction.md`. The prologue's vignettes provide a powerful, universal opening, while the introduction states the book's thesis.

2.  **Draft a New Introduction**: Create a new version of the introduction. This new version should:
    *   **Integrate the Story**: Seamlessly blend the personal origin story into the narrative. The story of the "brutally honest and judgement free conversation" is a perfect real-world example of the book's themes.
    *   **Maintain the Core Thesis**: The new intro must still clearly define the book's purpose: that brutal honesty is not about cruelty, but about radical respect. It should still serve as a compelling invitation to the reader.
    *   **Establish Authorial Voice**: Use the story to establish a voice that is both experienced and vulnerable, showing that the author has been on the same journey the reader is about to begin.

3.  **Placement Decision**: The new content is best placed in the **Introduction**. This allows the `Prologue` to remain a collection of universal, relatable "Scenes From an Un-Honest World," while the `Introduction` becomes the place where the author steps in to say, "I've seen this world too, and here's the story of how I found a way out."
