# Issue 010: Create Part III: Field Guide

## Goal

Reorganize the application-specific chapters into a practical "Part III: Field Guide," providing domain-specific playbooks for the most common and challenging areas of life.

## New Structure

-   **Chapter 9: Love & Friendship** (a revision of current `07_honesty_in_relationships.md`)
-   **Chapter 10: Family Systems & Repair** (a new chapter combining themes from `07_honesty_in_relationships.md` and `09_the_art_of_repair.md`)
-   **Chapter 11: Workplaces That Run on Truth** (a revision of current `10_brutal_honesty_at_work.md`)
-   **Chapter 12: From Personal Truth to Public Integrity** (new chapter)

## Action Items

1.  **Revise Chapter 9 (Love & Friendship)**:
    *   Refocus the current Chapter 7 to be specifically about romantic partnerships and friendships.
    *   Move the broader family dynamics and repair content to the new Chapter 10.
    *   Sharpen the advice on "Starting Honest" vs. "Course-Correcting" for these specific relationship types.

2.  **Create Chapter 10 (Family Systems & Repair)**:
    *   This new chapter should be the home for the brilliant "Art of Repair" content from the current Chapter 9.
    *   Integrate this with a dedicated discussion of family dynamics, a topic touched on in the old Chapter 7 but deserving of its own space.
    *   Address the complexities of honesty in families with ingrained hierarchies (parent-child, etc.).
    *   The "Maria and Ben" case study could be repurposed here, or a new, family-focused one could be created.

3.  **Revise Chapter 11 (Workplaces That Run on Truth)**:
    *   Update the current Chapter 10. While the new Chapter 6 will handle the general skill of managing power dynamics, this chapter should provide work-specific examples and scenarios.
    *   Ensure the "Feedback Without Sandwiches" and "Fake Consensus Detox" sections are prominent and actionable.
    *   Strengthen the "In the Interest of..." tactic with more examples.

4.  **Create Chapter 12 (From Personal Truth to Public Integrity)**:
    *   Write this new chapter to address the gap identified in `inputs.md` concerning larger social stakes.
    *   This is the "advanced" chapter on honesty.
    *   Use the "Triangle of Protection" framework (documentation, allies, exit strategy) as a core concept for would-be whistle-blowers or activists.
    *   Include ethical considerations and media-safe statement templates as suggested.
