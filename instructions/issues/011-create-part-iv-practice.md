# Issue 011: Create Part IV: Practice

## Goal

Develop a new, highly practical final section, "Part IV: Practice," to help readers implement the book's concepts and sustain them over the long term. This part will be almost entirely new content, turning the book into an interactive workbook.

## New Structure

-   **Chapter 13: The 30-Day Honesty Habit Plan** (new chapter)
-   **Chapter 14: Self-Assessment & Progress Quiz** (new chapter)
-   **Worksheets & Visual Aids** (new section)
-   **Epilogue: The Gathering** (reworked from the end of current `11_building_an_honest_life.md`)
-   **References & Further Reading** (new section)

## Action Items

1.  **Create Chapter 13 (The 30-Day Honesty Habit Plan)**:
    *   Design the 30-day program using the calendar-style table in `inputs.md` as a blueprint.
    *   For each of the 30 days, create a small, 5-20 minute drill that scaffolds the concepts from the book, starting with low-stakes exercises and building towards more challenging ones.
    *   This chapter should explicitly reference earlier chapters for context on specific exercises.

2.  **Create Chapter 14 (Self-Assessment & Progress Quiz)**:
    *   Create the 20-question quiz outlined in `inputs.md`.
    *   Use a Likert scale (1 = never, 5 = always) for scoring.
    *   Define the scoring bands clearly: *Aware (0-40), Emerging (41-60), Practicing (61-80), Fluent (81-100)*.
    *   The quiz should be designed to be taken before reading the book and after completing the 30-day plan to measure progress.

3.  **Create the Worksheets & Visual Aids Section**:
    *   Design a single page that serves as a portal for downloadable resources.
    *   This page must feature a prominent (placeholder) URL and/or QR code.
    *   It should clearly list the assets available for download, as suggested in `inputs.md` (e.g., Honest-Email template, Conversation Decision-Tree, 30-Day Calendar, etc.).

4.  **Rework the Epilogue**:
    *   Take the powerful "The Gathering" section from the end of the current Chapter 11 and craft it into a standalone Epilogue. This will serve as a powerful, inspiring conclusion to the book.

5.  **Compile References & Further Reading**:
    *   Create a properly formatted bibliography.
    *   Start with the sources mentioned in `inputs.md` (Edmondson, Pennebaker, Rosenberg, Heffernan).
    *   Add any other academic sources or books that are referenced in the new "Research Snapshot" boxes throughout the manuscript.
