# Issue 009: Create Part II: Skillset

## Goal

Build out "Part II: Skillset," the practical core of the book. This section will equip readers with the "how-to" of brutal honesty by revising the existing tools chapter and adding three new chapters to address critical modern challenges.

## New Structure

-   **Chapter 5: Tools for Tough Conversations** (a revision of current `06_tools_for_tough_conversations.md`)
-   **Chapter 6: Handling Power Gradients & Cultural Nuance** (new chapter)
-   **Chapter 7: Digital-First Honesty** (new chapter)
-   **Chapter 8: Neurodiversity: Honesty as Baseline Super-Power** (new chapter)

## Action Items

1.  **Revise Chapter 5 (Tools for Tough Conversations)**:
    *   Review the existing frameworks (Preface, Frame, Fallback).
    *   Sharpen the examples and make them more distinct.
    *   Incorporate the idea from `inputs.md` of creating simple visual icons for each tool to make them more memorable.

2.  **Create Chapter 6 (Handling Power Gradients & Cultural Nuance)**:
    *   This is a crucial new chapter that directly addresses feedback about the risks of honesty in hierarchical situations.
    *   Synthesize and expand upon the "Cultural Nuance" section from the old Ch 4 and the "Honesty Up and Down the Ladder" section from the old Ch 10.
    *   Build out the "managing up" section with concrete scripts and safety strategies, using the "Safety Valve Matrix" from `inputs.md` as a guide.

3.  **Create Chapter 7 (Digital-First Honesty)**:
    *   Write this chapter from scratch to address the major gap of online communication.
    *   Use the excellent outline from `inputs.md` as the chapter structure:
        *   Subject-Line Transparency (e.g., `[Heads-up] Feedback on X`).
        *   The "60-Second Video" Rule for nuanced topics.
        *   A Slack/Teams "Cheat Sheet" for clearer asynchronous communication (e.g., using emojis to signal intent like `ðŸ‘€` for "I'm thinking about this").

4.  **Create Chapter 8 (Neurodiversity: Honesty as Baseline Super-Power)**:
    *   Write this new chapter with care and nuance.
    *   The framing suggested in `inputs.md` is key: this is not about teaching neurodivergent people to be honest, but about helping them calibrate their natural directness to be effective without masking.
    *   Develop the suggested strategies like "Color-Tagging" messages by type (info, feedback, critical) and creating explicit team agreements on communication styles ("blunt-mode on/off").
    *   If possible, include a short, quoted case story from an autistic or ADHD professional.
