# Issue 012: Apply Micro-Edits and Polish

## Goal

Perform a full-pass on the entire revised manuscript to fix small errors, apply stylistic suggestions, and ensure a high level of polish and consistency, based on the "Micro-edits & nit-picks" section of `instructions/edits/inputs/inputs.md`.

## Action Items

This task should be performed after all major restructuring and writing (Issues #007-#011) are complete. It should be treated as a final-pass checklist.

### Checklist

-   [ ] **Spelling Consistency**: Search the entire manuscript for "phoney" and replace it with "phony" to maintain U.S. spelling consistency.

-   [ ] **Consolidate Concepts**: In the new Chapter 1 ("What Brutal Honesty Isâ€”and Is Not"), review the "Key Distinctions" section. Evaluate if the points on "Cruelty" and "Performative Bluntness" can be merged or sharpened to remove any perceived overlap and increase their impact.

-   [ ] **Eliminate Duplicate Examples**: The feedback noted that the example of giving feedback about "typos" appears more than once. Locate all instances and ensure it is used only a single time in the most appropriate context (likely in the new Chapter 11, "Workplaces That Run on Truth").

-   [ ] **Review Rhetorical Questions**: Scan the manuscript for clusters of rhetorical questions (e.g., "Are you really...?"). While powerful, they can be numbing if overused. Assess each cluster and either trim it or rephrase some questions into statements to ensure they retain their punch.

-   [ ] **General Proofread**: Conduct a comprehensive proofread of the final, assembled `fullbook.md` for any remaining spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors.
