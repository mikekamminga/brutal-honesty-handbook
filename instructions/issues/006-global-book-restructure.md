# Issue 006: Global Book Restructure for Second Edition

## Goal

Restructure the entire book into four distinct parts as outlined in the "Highest-leverage upgrades" section of `instructions/edits/inputs/inputs.md`:

1.  **Part I: Mindset** (Why and what)
2.  **Part II: Skillset** (Practical mechanics)
3.  **Part III: Field Guide** (Domain-specific playbooks)
4.  **Part IV: Practice** (Habits, measurement, and resources)

This new architecture will create a clearer journey for the reader, improve navigation, and eliminate the repetition noted in the feedback.

## Master Plan

The new **Table of Contents** proposed in `inputs.md` will serve as the master plan for this restructuring effort. All content changes should align with this new structure.

## Meta-Task

This issue is a "meta-task" that oversees the entire restructuring. It will be considered complete when the following sub-tasks (to be detailed in their own issue files) are resolved:

-   [ ] **#7:** Incorporate Author's Origin Story
-   [ ] **#8:** Refactor Part I: Mindset
-   [ ] **#9:** Create Part II: Skillset
-   [ ] **#10:** Create Part III: Field Guide
-   [ ] **#11:** Create Part IV: Practice
-   [ ] **#12:** Apply Micro-Edits and Polish

## Final Deliverables

-   An updated `book/index.md` reflecting the new four-part structure and chapter list.
-   A new, consolidated `book/fullbook.md` generated from the revised and newly created chapter files.
-   Individual markdown files for each new and revised chapter, organized according to the new structure.
