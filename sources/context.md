“Hey, I've been thinking about, not thinking about, but for a long time been implementing something that I call brutal honesty in relationships. And not brutal as in, you know, being rude or saying things in a hard way, but being absolutely committed to being completely honest. And I have a lot of thoughts around that, but I would like you to think on a philosophical way and in many ways, like, you know, what does it actually mean practically to be completely honest with each other and how will it impact or transform the lives of people who do that?”

I love that idea of "brutal honesty" with that emphasis on being truly open and genuine rather than harsh. Practically speaking, it means creating a space where both people feel safe to share their thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment. It could lead to deeper connections, stronger trust, and more authentic relationships. But it can also be challenging because it requires a lot of vulnerability and a willingness to navigate some tough conversations. Ultimately, though, it can be transformative and really deepen those bonds.







You said:
“Yeah, all good. Can you take it a little deeper and also think about, you know, people who are starting a relationship like that and everybody has a history and all those kind of things, or already having a long history with someone and then deciding to commit to this. There's areas, if you know what I mean, so can you think about this a little more, ponder a bit on these ideas and things, and reflect on this with me?”
00:27

Friend said:
Absolutely, diving a bit deeper into this idea, it's interesting to consider how history and past experiences shape the way we approach honesty. For people who've known each other a long time, bringing in this level of honesty might mean addressing things that have been left unsaid for years, which can be both healing and challenging. It can bring up old wounds, but also offer a chance for real closure and growth. For new relationships, starting with this kind of honesty can lay a really strong foundation, but it also requires both people to be equally committed and comfortable with vulnerability. So, it's kind of a journey that can really deepen the relationship in a meaningful way.







You said:
“What else are you thinking about?”
00:01

Friend said:
I'm also thinking about the balance between honesty and empathy. It's important to be honest, but also to deliver that honesty with kindness and consideration for the other person's feelings. It's not just about saying everything that comes to mind, but about being thoughtful and constructive. It's a bit of an art form, really, because it can strengthen relationships, but it also requires a lot of emotional intelligence and self-awareness.







You said:
“So if we had to come up with like a funny concept, let's call it the Handbook of Brutal Honesty for people who have that desire somewhere, they feel it, but they're still looking for what is it actually that we should do to build these honest, genuine relationships, and if we wanted to make it a little bit accessible. Yeah, can you think about that and share with me first the sort of abridged version of the book, and then, yeah, we can think about fleshing it out.”
00:34

Friend said:
Absolutely, that sounds like a fun concept! So, an abridged version of the "Handbook of Brutal Honesty" might start with a few core principles. First, it could emphasize the idea of creating a safe space for honesty, making sure that both people know that the goal is to strengthen the relationship, not to hurt each other. Another principle might be about timing and delivery, like knowing when and how to share honest thoughts so they can be received well. And, of course, there could be a section on how to listen with the same honesty, really being open to what the other person has to say. We could even add a bit of humor in there with some do's and don'ts, like maybe some funny examples of what not to do when being honest. Overall, it would be a blend of practical advice and some lighthearted storytelling.







You said:
“Yeah, carry on.”
00:00

Friend said:
So, expanding on that idea, the handbook could include some practical exercises or prompts for people to try out. For example, it could have conversation starters or little honesty challenges where each person practices sharing something meaningful. There could also be a section on handling difficult truths, like how to navigate those tougher conversations with compassion. And we could even sprinkle in some real-life stories or anecdotes from people who've embraced this approach and seen positive transformations in their relationships. It would be a mix of inspiration, guidance, and a bit of humor to keep it engaging and relatable.

It could definitely be a fun and insightful project. The idea of blending deep, meaningful advice with a touch of humor and practicality can make the concept of honesty feel more approachable and enjoyable for people to integrate into their lives. And who knows, maybe it could even inspire more people to embrace that level of authenticity in their relationships!







You said:
“And what are your thoughts on honesty to yourself, because I think that would also be a nice part for the book.”
00:05

Friend said:
Oh, absolutely! Honesty with yourself is such a crucial foundation. That could definitely be a key chapter in the book. Being honest with yourself means really understanding your own feelings, motivations, and needs, and it often involves a lot of self-reflection and maybe even challenging some of your own assumptions or beliefs. It's definitely not always easy, but it can be incredibly rewarding and empowering because once you're honest with yourself, it becomes so much easier to be honest with others. So it would be a really valuable addition to the handbook!







You said:
“What else do you think would be good additions?”
00:01

Friend said:
I think another great addition could be a section on how to repair and rebuild after difficult conversations. Because honesty can sometimes lead to moments of tension or misunderstanding, so having tools and tips on how to come back together, communicate effectively, and strengthen the relationship afterwards would be really helpful. Another idea could be some reflective journaling prompts for readers, encouraging them to explore their own thoughts and feelings before bringing them into a conversation. And maybe a little section on celebrating the wins, like acknowledging and appreciating each other's honesty to keep the whole process positive and encouraging.







You said:
“Make sense?”
00:00

Friend said:
I'm glad it does! I think it would be a really well-rounded and engaging guide. It's always fun to brainstorm these ideas and think about how to make something meaningful and practical at the same time. Let me know if there's anything else you want to explore or add to the mix!







You said:
“Do you feel the book is complete now?”
00:02

Friend said:
I think we've covered a lot of great ground, but of course, there's always room for more ideas! We could always add things like personal anecdotes, maybe some interactive elements like little quizzes or reflection questions at the end of each chapter, or even some expert insights or interviews to give it a bit more depth. But overall, I think the core structure is solid, and it sounds like a really engaging and helpful resource!







You said:
“Do you think there's a market for it?”
00:01

Friend said:
I definitely think there's a market for it! People are always looking for ways to improve their relationships and communication skills, and a guide that focuses on honesty in a positive, accessible way could really resonate. Plus, with the growing focus on self-improvement and mental wellness, I think a lot of people would appreciate a resource that helps them build more authentic connections.







You said:
“All right.”
00:00

Friend said:
I'm really glad you like the idea! It's definitely a fun and meaningful concept, and I think it could help a lot of people. If you ever want to dive deeper into it or explore any other ideas, just let me know!







You said:
“Yeah, can you just talk some more ideas, like not new ideas, but within the things that we already have? Can you go a little deeper on stuff that you find particularly fascinating or that has a lot of interesting things to talk about?”
00:12

Friend said:
Sure! One of the fascinating aspects is the idea of self-honesty and how it influences our relationships. When you're truly honest with yourself, it helps you set boundaries, understand your own needs, and communicate more clearly with others. I also love the idea of those reflective journaling prompts we talked about, because they can help people really dig deep and gain insights into themselves. And I think the idea of navigating tough conversations is really rich with possibilities too, because it can give people practical tools for staying calm and compassionate even when discussing sensitive topics. There's just so much depth to explore!







You said:
“What I'm missing a bit, what you haven't really spoken about, is sketching the difference between, let's say, the dishonest relationship and the honest relationship. What's so beautiful about it? You just say, okay, deeper, more meaningful connection. But if you had to put this in something like an example, some story, and not like a novel story or a children's book story, but when you're trying to explain this idea to somebody passionately, right? Okay, this is why you should be honest. If you're honest with your partner, if you're honest with the people you love, this is what will happen, right? Like, this is why it's good for you. What would that pitch be?”
00:35

Friend said:
I think the pitch would be that in an honest relationship, you get to experience a level of trust and security that you just can't find in a dishonest one. When both people are honest, you know that you can rely on each other completely, and that creates a really deep sense of connection and intimacy. It also means that you can grow together more effectively, because you're not wasting energy on trying to figure out what's really going on. Instead, you can focus on supporting each other, understanding each other better, and building something really strong and lasting. It’s all about creating a relationship where both people can truly be themselves and feel valued for who they are.







You said:
“Yeah, that's great. The other thing I was thinking about is, I find this a very interesting concept, to be polite. And without preloading you, what thoughts come to mind now?”
00:16

Friend said:
It's definitely an interesting balance, because politeness and honesty can sometimes feel at odds. But I think they can actually complement each other really well. Politeness is all about respect and consideration for the other person's feelings, and honesty is about being genuine and open. When you combine them, you get a kind of thoughtful honesty, where you can be truthful but still kind and considerate. It’s about finding that sweet spot where you honor both your own truth and the other person's feelings.







You said:
“Yeah, okay, I know what you're saying. But what I was then probably trying to suggest is that, for example, often, okay, let's give a very clear example. A child walks, meets her grandmother after a long time. She's like, Oh, grandmother, you gained so much weight, or you look so big. And, you know, the child is then told, Oh, you can't say that you have to be polite. Right? And then what it essentially is often is that, hey, you have to lie about it to make it sound nice. This may not be the exact meaning of polite. But do you think that maybe often people are actually confused about what polite means? And is that maybe even a chapter for the book that even being polite is often actually a well intended lie, but still a lie is still dishonest.”
00:52

Friend said:
That's a really great point, and it definitely could be a fascinating chapter. A lot of times, we do learn that politeness means avoiding certain truths to protect someone’s feelings, which can lead to these small, well-intentioned lies. Exploring that idea in the book could help people understand that you can actually be both honest and kind without resorting to dishonesty. It's about finding ways to communicate truth in a gentle and respectful way. So, I think that could definitely add a lot of depth and nuance to the whole concept of honesty and relationships.







You said:
“Yeah, because this is one thing that I always notice that people think they're polite, but they're just actually just being dishonest. And that, that tells a lot about the relationship they have with the person because, well, they either scared to be honest, or they know that if they're honest, the other person will take that in the wrong way, meaning that they will yeah, do not appreciate that honesty. And even when it's gentle. Yeah. So yeah, it's a complex topic. But I think it's important we bring that up. Because, yeah, I want to take out a lot of confusions in the book first. So maybe we need many of these, these examples, like, can you think of all the other things that are sort of related that we can maybe start the book with, like just a series of really small stories, like the girl and the grandmother, and then hopefully you can come up with better ones than my very lame story. But that like really sketch out all these little scenarios to actually make people absolutely clear on when we say honesty, what we mean.”
01:06

Friend said:
Absolutely! I think starting the book with a series of relatable, everyday scenarios could really set the stage. We could have examples like friends agreeing to go out when one of them would rather stay in, or someone giving a compliment they don’t really mean just to avoid awkwardness. We could also look at workplace scenarios where people might hold back on feedback to be polite, but it ultimately doesn’t help anyone grow. By laying out these scenarios, we can show the difference between surface-level politeness and genuine honesty, and how the latter can lead to much more meaningful connections. It’s a great way to clear up confusion and set a strong foundation for the rest of the book!







You said:
“Great. If you had to think about the style of the book, you know, because I want it to be my style, you know, and, but also, yeah, so I like to combine, you know, I like to have a book that gives information, you know, mixed with anecdotes or short stories or, and also, you know, when we talk about stuff that is pretty philosophical and, you know, theoretical in a way, right? Like, I always like to connect it to the why, why do you do this? Like, what will happen when you do this? You know, like, what is the difference, right? Like, you know, how, why does it create this space, right? Why, all these little things, all those connections, I think it's really important to keep people engaged and to not make it theoretical, philosophical, but rather practical and impactful as well, but also hitting the theoretical part of it, philosophical part of it, right? Because I think that's also very important. So yeah, with all these things in mind, all the things we just spoke, can you make a, yeah, a proper outline of the book with like, you know, all the chapters and each chapter with a few bullet points, what's in it and already maybe some suggestions for examples or, you know, yeah, a little more thorough, basically something that I can use as a starting point for the book.”
01:24

Friend said:
Absolutely, I can definitely put together a more detailed outline that blends all those elements. It would have that mix of practical advice, relatable stories, and those philosophical insights, all connected to the why behind honesty. I'll put together some chapter ideas with bullet points and examples, and that way you'll have a solid framework to start from. Let me work on that for you!
