## CHAPTER 15: SELF-ASSESSMENT & PROGRESS QUIZ

This quiz is a tool for self-reflection. It's designed to give you a benchmark of where you are right now in your honesty practice. Take it once before you begin the 30-Day Plan in Chapter 14, and then again after you complete it to see how you've grown.

For each statement, rate yourself on a scale of 1 to 5, where:
*   **1** = Never
*   **2** = Rarely
*   **3** = Sometimes
*   **4** = Often
*   **5** = Always

Be brutally honest with yourself. There are no right or wrong answers.
