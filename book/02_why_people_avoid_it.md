## CHAPTER 2: WHY MOST PEOPLE AVOID IT

Let's be honest about honesty: most of us avoid it like the plague.

We praise it in the abstract. We claim to value it in our partners and leaders. But when a moment of real truth arrives—raw, inconvenient, and right in front of us—we instinctively duck and cover. We change the subject, soften the blow, or retreat into a strategic silence.

Why? Because truth has consequences. And we have been trained since childhood to avoid conflict, to stay likable, to not rock the boat. Telling the truth feels dangerous. And in some ways, it is. To understand why we lie, we have to get brutally honest about our fears.

### The Big Three Fears

Beneath almost every act of dishonesty, you'll find one of these three fundamental fears, often working in concert.

**1. Fear of Hurting Someone**
This is the "noble" lie, the one that feels altruistic. You don't want to be the source of someone's pain. Your friend asks if you like the terrible painting they poured their heart into. Saying "no" feels like crushing a part of their soul. So you say, "It's so vibrant!" and die a little inside. You tell yourself you are being kind, but you are merely postponing a necessary truth and letting a bad situation—in this case, your friend's potential delusion about their artistic talent—get worse. True kindness would be gentle but honest feedback that could actually help them grow.

**2. Fear of Confrontation**
For many, the word "confrontation" conjures images of screaming matches, slammed doors, and ruined holidays. It feels like chaos. This fear is often rooted in our past: homes where conflict meant punishment, schools where disagreement led to ridicule, or workplaces where speaking up got you labeled as "difficult." Your upstairs neighbor has been playing loud music every night, but instead of knocking on their door, you buy earplugs and let resentment build. You avoid a five-minute awkward conversation at the cost of weeks of sleepless, bitter nights. Avoiding a necessary confrontation doesn't prevent conflict; it guarantees a bigger, messier one down the line.

**3. Fear of Being Disliked**
This is the deepest, most primal fear. We are social creatures, wired for belonging. Rejection can feel like a survival threat. So you go to the party you don't want to go to. You laugh at the joke you find offensive. You agree with the political opinion that makes your skin crawl. You learn to perform, becoming a chameleon who says what people want to hear. But performance is exhausting. And it is profoundly lonely. You end up surrounded by people who like a version of you that doesn't actually exist.

### The True Cost of Avoidance

Here's what really happens when you choose the comfort of a lie over the risk of the truth:

*   **Small issues metastasize.** A minor annoyance, left unaddressed, festers into deep-seated resentment that poisons the entire relationship.
*   **You build a prison of false expectations.** People fall in love with, befriend, or hire a person who you are only pretending to be. Sooner or later, the mask will slip, and the fallout will be far worse than an early, honest admission of who you are.
*   **You feel like an imposter in your own life.** Living a lie is exhausting. You feel trapped in relationships and situations you secretly want to escape, but you can't see the exit because you've hidden it behind a wall of your own dishonesty.

Avoidance is not kindness. It's a slow, corrosive acid that eats away at the foundation of trust—both their trust in you and your trust in yourself.

> "Avoiding honesty doesn't prevent pain. It just makes it deeper, slower, and more destructive when it finally surfaces."

### The Lies We Tell Ourselves to Justify the Lies We Tell Others

We are masters of self-deception. We justify our avoidance with clever rationalizations that paint our cowardice as consideration.

*   *"It's not the right time."* (But is there ever a "perfect" time for a hard truth? Or is this just an excuse for indefinite postponement?)
*   *"They're too fragile to handle it."* (Are you protecting them, or are you underestimating their resilience and protecting yourself from their reaction?)
*   *"I don't want to make a big deal out of it."* (But by avoiding it, aren't you ensuring it becomes a much bigger deal when it finally explodes?)

Let's be brutally honest: most of the time, we are protecting ourselves, not them. We are choosing our own short-term comfort over their long-term benefit and the health of the relationship. When the truth finally does surface—and it always does—it's ten times messier, because now it's tangled up with the additional betrayal of all the silence.

### Practice: Confront Your Avoidance

Pick one recent moment where you avoided saying something true. A small one will do. Maybe you told your friend you loved the movie you both just watched, when you actually hated it.

Ask yourself:
*   What was I *really* afraid would happen if I was honest? (e.g., "We would argue," "They would think I have bad taste," "It would ruin an otherwise pleasant evening.")
*   Did avoiding the truth solve anything, or did it just prevent a moment of real connection and understanding?
*   What would a brutally honest but kind alternative have looked like? (e.g., "You know, that movie wasn't my favorite, but I'm so glad we got to see it together. What did you love about it?")

Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes it's the quiet, firm decision to no longer participate in your own deception.

Start there.
