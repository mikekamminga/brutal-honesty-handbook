## CHAPTER 8: NEURODIVERSITY & HONESTY

For many people, the challenge of this book is learning to be more direct. But for some neurodivergent people—particularly those who are autistic or have ADHD—the opposite is true. Direct, unfiltered honesty is often their baseline, their natural mode of communication. The social pressure to soften, to hint, and to engage in "polite lies" can feel like being asked to speak a foreign language, leading to exhaustion and a feeling of "masking" one's true self.

This chapter is not about teaching you to be less honest. It is about honoring your natural communication style while providing strategies to calibrate it, ensuring your truth can be heard and respected without demanding that you pretend to be someone you're not.

### Your Honesty Is a Superpower, Not a Flaw

In a world full of vague talk and hidden agendas, your ability to see and state things clearly is a superpower. It cuts through noise, solves problems efficiently, and creates a foundation of reliability. The goal is not to blunt this superpower, but to build a user interface for it that others can understand.

Think of it not as changing your message, but as providing context so the message can be received.

### Strategies for Calibration, Not Masking

*   **Explicitly State Your Communication Style:** One of the most powerful things you can do is to simply tell people how you communicate. For example, you might say to a new team: "I want to let you know that I tend to be very direct. My intention is always to be clear and helpful, not to be blunt or unkind. If my directness ever comes across the wrong way, please let me know." This provides a frame for all future interactions.

*   **Color-Tag Your Messages:** In digital communication, you can use a simple system to signal the intent of your message, removing ambiguity for the reader.
    *   **[Green]**: For information sharing. "\[Green] The report is done."
    *   **[Yellow]**: For feedback or a request. "\[Yellow] I have some feedback on the design. Is now a good time?"
    *   **[Red]**: For urgent or critical issues. "\[Red] The server is down. We need to address this immediately."

*   **Establish Team Signal Agreements:** In a team setting, you can create explicit, opt-in agreements for communication.
    *   **"Blunt-Mode On/Off":** A team can agree that during specific meetings (like a brainstorming or "red-teaming" session), "blunt-mode is on," and all direct feedback is welcome without fear of offense.
    *   **"Is this a 'vent' or a 'fix' moment?":** Before a colleague shares a problem, you can ask them to clarify if they are looking for solutions or just a listening ear. This prevents you from jumping into problem-solving mode when it isn't wanted.

*   **Ask for Accommodations:** It is perfectly reasonable to ask for what you need to communicate effectively. This might include:
    *   "Could you please provide feedback in writing? It helps me process it better."
    *   "I appreciate directness. You don't need to soften your language for me."

The goal of brutal honesty is to create a world where more people can be their authentic selves. For neurodivergent individuals, this means creating a space where their natural honesty is seen as the asset it is, and providing tools to bridge the gap with those who speak a less direct language.
