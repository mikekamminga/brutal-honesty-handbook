# EPILOGUE: THE GATHERING

Something remarkable will happen as you continue this practice. It will be slow at first, then all at once. The people in your life who are sustained by illusion and polite lies will begin to drift away. The fakeness was the glue holding those relationships together, and without it, there is nothing left. This will be painful, but it is a necessary and healthy pruning.

And then, the gathering begins.

The people who value truth, who crave authenticity, who are also trying to live a real lifeâ€”they will gather around you. Your realness will act as a beacon. Your friendships will deepen. Your romantic relationships will become more intimate. Your professional connections will become more powerful and less political.

You will realize, in time, that you never needed the lies. The approval you were chasing by being a performance is a pale imitation of the acceptance you receive by being real.

This is the promise of brutal honesty. It won't make your life easy. But it will make it whole.

Welcome to your honest life.
