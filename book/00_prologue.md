## PROLOGUE: SCENES FROM AN UN-HONEST WORLD

A child looks at her grandmother, whom she hasn't seen in a year. "Wow, you got bigger," she says, with the simple clarity of a child who speaks only what she sees. The mother gasps, rushes to apologize, and later whispers to her daughter, "You can't say that. It's not polite." The lesson is filed away: *Don't say what you see. Lie to be kind.*

A friend proudly shows you their new apartment. You step inside and your heart sinks. The colors clash, the layout is awkward, it feels cramped. "What do you think?" they ask, eyes shining with excitement. "It has so much potential!" you reply, forcing a smile. You leave feeling like a phoney, a small crack forming in the foundation of your friendship.

Your boss announces a bold new strategy that you know, from your experience on the front lines, is destined to fail. You look around the room. Everyone is nodding. So you nod, too. The real conversations happen later, in hushed tones with colleagues over coffee, a conspiracy of agreement against the official plan. Six months later, the project collapses, taking thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of wasted effort with it.

Your partner rolls over in bed and asks, "Is everything okay?" And it isn't. Not really. The distance between you has been growing for months into a quiet, cold expanse. But the thought of the conversation that would follow—the mess, the hurt, the sheer uncertainty—is too much to bear. "I'm just tired," you say. The silence that follows is heavier than any argument.

These are the polite lies. The small evasions. The moments of silence where a truth should be. They feel safe. They feel kind. In the moment, they feel like the path of least resistance.

But they are the building blocks of a life based on illusion. Each one is a brick in a wall between you and the people you love, between you and the work you do, between you and your own reality.

This book is about choosing a different path. It is a practical guide to tearing down that wall, brick by brick.
