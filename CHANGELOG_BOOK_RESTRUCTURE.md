## 🚀 **Why This Change Matters**

**Problem Solved:** Original structure artificially constrained universal repair skills to family relationships, creating gaps in other relationship chapters.

**Improvement:** Now repair is positioned as a foundational skill (like conversation tools) that applies across all contexts, with family chapter focused on what's uniquely challenging about family dynamics.

**User Benefit:** Readers can now access repair skills for ANY relationship context, not just family situations.
